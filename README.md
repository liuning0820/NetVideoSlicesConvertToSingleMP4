# NetVideoSlicesConvertToSingleMP4

Firefox extenstion "NetVideoHunter" can help to download the video slices to local.
but normally the source slices will be in format *.ts, *flv, *.mp4.

I have the idea to use ffmpeg tool to convert the slices for a video into a single mp4 file.
then I can play it from my house TV by open the converted file in my own NAS(raspberry share folder).
